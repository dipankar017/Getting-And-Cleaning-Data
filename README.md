## The name data used on this script can be found here.

## We found the data on "UCI HAR Dataset".

## We need the following files:

activity_labels.txt

features.txt

subject_test.txt

subject_train.txt

X_test.txt

X_train.txt

y_test.txt

y_train.txt

## For the script to work you need to put the UCI HAR Dataset on your R working directory.

## The code This project has only one script run_analysis.R. This code turns all the files above on a tidy dataset, 
by doing the following:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each 
measurement. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive 
activity names. Creates a independent tidy data set which is called tidy.cs v with the average of each variable for each activity and each 
subject. Detailed information about generated datasets can be found on the CodeBook.md file.
